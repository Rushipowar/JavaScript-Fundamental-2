// Explain:-
//  The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional statements 
//  in many programming languages including C, C++, Java, Python, and more. It allows you to evaluate a condition 
//  and return one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.


// code:-
const num = 10; 
const result = (num % 2 === 0) ? "even" : "odd";

console.log(`The number is ${result}.`);
